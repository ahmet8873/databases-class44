# Database Normalization Analysis

To ensure that the database is in the first normal form (1NF), we need to identify and address any columns with multiple values. In 1NF, each column should contain atomic (indivisible) values. Looking at the provided table, the "food_code" and "food_description" columns violate 1NF as they contain multiple values separated by commas.

The following entities have been recognized:

- Members
- Dinners
- Venues
- Foods

## Tables in 3NF Compliant Solution

To bring the database to 1NF, we need to separate tables for each entity and store atomic values in each column. Here's how we can achieve a 3NF-compliant structure:

### Members Table

- 'member_id' (Primary Key)
- 'member_name'
- 'member_address'

### Dinners Table

- 'dinner_id' (Primary Key)
- 'dinner_date'
- 'venue_code' (Foreign Key referencing Venues Table)

### Venues Table

- 'venue_code' (Primary Key)
- 'venue_description'

### Foods Table

- 'food_code' (Primary Key)
- 'food_description'

### Dinners_Foods Junction Table

To manage the many-to-many relationship between Dinners and Foods, we create a junction table:

- 'dinner_id' (Foreign Key referencing Dinners Table)
- 'food_code' (Foreign Key referencing Foods Table)

In this structure, we have eliminated the violation of 1NF by creating separate tables for each entity and storing atomic values in each column. The many-to-many relationship between Dinners and Foods is managed through the Dinners_Foods junction table. This design also ensures 2NF and 3NF compliance.
